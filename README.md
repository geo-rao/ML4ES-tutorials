# ML4ES-tutorials
This is the tutorials repo for Machine Learning for Earth Sciences (ML4ES). To launch the tutorials, 

1. Simply click the __*launch binder*__ button to enter the virtual environment where you can directly run the notebook on binder. With binder, you don't need to configure anything on your computer.

2. Once you are in the binder space, click __*New*__ on the top right corner of your virtual workspace, and select __*RStudio*__ to use the **_"NCICS-MLtraining-Tutorials-E05.Rmd"_** notebook.

3. You can modify the code in the R notebook while you are exploring the tutorials. However, the change will not be saved in the virtual environment. In order to save your change, you can download the modified notebook to your local environment for your personal use.
