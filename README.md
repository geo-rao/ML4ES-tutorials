# ML4ES-tutorials
This is the tutorials repo for Machine Learning for Earth Sciences (ML4ES) for NCICS/CISESS. To launch the tutorials, 

1. Simply click the ![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg) button to enter the virtual environment where you can directly run the notebook on binder. With binder, you don't need to configure anything on your computer.

2. Once you are in the binder space, it will establish a __*RStudio*__ environment for you. You can find the file list in your virtual environment on the right bottom side of your screen. By navigating through the folders, you will be able to start using the notebook.

3. You can modify the code in the R notebook while you are exploring the tutorials. However, the change will not be saved in the virtual environment. In order to save your change, you can download the modified notebook to your local environment for your personal use.
